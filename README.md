# C 🖥️ – Function-Pointer Calculator

**First project** for learning purposes – created on: 2.12.2025

**Project goal:**
Create a menu-driven calculator in C, using function pointers to perform various mathematical operations. Gradually added features with each update.

## Features & Updates
Initial version – 2.12.2025
 - Addition
 - Subtraction
 - Multiplication
 - Division
 - Exponentiation
 - Square root(uses only the first number)
